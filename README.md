  <h1>Personal Portfolio API</h1>
</p>

## Description

This is a personal portfolio API built with the [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. It serves as the backend for my personal website, handling various features like curriculum management, project showcase, and more. The use of NestJS, combined with TypeScript, provides a robust foundation for building scalable back-end applications.

## Features

- Curriculum display and management
- Health monitoring
- User authentication via username/password and token
- CRUD operations for Work Records, Projects, and Shader Arts

## Why NestJS?

Building on top of NestJS demonstrates:
- A strong understanding of design patterns
- The ability to transform feature requests into a comprehensive Feature Development Plan
- The capability to design loosely coupled and extensible code

This showcases my ability to comprehend and extend enterprise-level code by adding new features.

## Local Development Setup

First, install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Configure the `.env` file with the correct database credentials or use local storage.

Run the application:
```bash
npm run start dev
```
